# Fake News Detection

## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fake news articles. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and various machine learning techniques, we can classify news articles as real or fake with high accuracy.

## Features

- Preprocessing of text data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison
- User-friendly interface for news verification
