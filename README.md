# Fake News Detection

## Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fake news articles. By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and various machine learning techniques, we can classify news articles as real or fake with high accuracy.

## Features

- Preprocessing of text data
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Implementation of various machine learning algorithms
- Model evaluation and comparison
- User-friendly interface for news verification

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.

git clone https://github.com/Suji-2003/fake-news-detection.git
cd fake-news-detection
pip install -r requirements.txt

## Usage
- Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the text data.
- Feature Extraction: Extract features using techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
- Model Training: Train various machine learning models.
- Model Evaluation: Evaluate the models using appropriate metrics.
- Prediction: Use the trained model to predict new articles.
  
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of news articles labeled as real or fake.

## Models
Several machine learning models are implemented and compared in this project:
- Logistic Regression
- Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting

## Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
