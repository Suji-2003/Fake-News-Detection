Fake News Detection

Overview :

This project aims to build a machine learning model to detect fake news articles.By leveraging natural language processing (NLP) and various machine learning techniques,we can classify news articles as real or fake with high accuracy.

Features
Preprocessing of text data
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Implementation of various machine learning algorithms
Model evaluation and comparison
User-friendly interface for news verification

Dataset
The dataset used in this project consists of news articles labeled as real or fake.

Models
Several machine learning models are implemented and compared in this project:
Logistic Regression
Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Random Forest
Gradient Boosting

Results
The performance of each model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. The best-performing model achieves an accuracy of XX%.
